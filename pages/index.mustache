                    Current state-of-the-art neural networks employed in
                    image recognition and decision making software require
                    enormous, highly specialized datasets for their training.
                    The result is a rigid AI that is only capable of fulfilling
                    a single, well defined task.
                    This restriction does not reflect the evergrowing challenges
                    of the real world.
                    As intelligent beings, we overcome difficulties by recollecting
                    knowledge from many independent domains. When our understanding of the
                    world reaches a limit, we explore it and bend its rules in order
                    to independendly increase our knowledge. All without a pre-labeled database.

                    What we seek is a general artificial intelligence which is capable
                    of the same autonomous solution-finding that humans are capable of
                    since their infancy.

                    Instead of treating the mind as a black box with clearly defined
                    inputs that are translated into outputs, we interpret the brain as
                    a complex intertwined machine with an everchanging internal state.
                    Our neural networks are modelled after real neurons and their connections,
                    down to the electrochemical level. The neurons themselves hold an
                    electrical charge that changes over time, allowing the network to
                    adapt to new situations. This eliminates the traditional division
                    between separate training and working phases, allowing the network
                    to continuously learn while facing its challenges.

                    A neural network needs a way to build upon its success in order to constantly improve.
                    We think that the best role model for a training method is the real world
                    and the circumstances which lead to our species' own intellect.
                    The blueprint of our simulated brains is encoded in an artificial DNA,
                    which changes and improves the neural networks by Darwin's universal laws of evolution.
                    The simulated genetic structure is modeled after the most recent discoveries
                    in the young field of evolutionary developmental biology, preserving the
                    inherent flexibility that gave birth to the countless forms of life we see every day.

                    In our opinion, the primary factors behind humanities intellectual dominance
                    are the abilities to adapt to environmental changes and to band knowledge
                    together when confronted with problems that outscale one's own personal
                    abilities. These qualities cannot be expressed in abstract mathematical terms.
                    They can only be learned by being exposed to the world. This is why the
                    training of our neural networks happens inside a simulated physical world.
                    Because we programmed this simulation on top of our own in-house developed engine,
                    we have the freedom to introduce arbitrary dynamic tasks that the simulated
                    organisms need to overcome adaptively in order to propagate.
                    This way, we can guide the ensuing evolution in whatever direction we need.
